# password-generator

The objective of this project was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by accompanying JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface, and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
